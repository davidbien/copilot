I want copilot to remember these things throughout our work together and always abide by these rules when showing me C++ code, C, C#, javascript, java, and HTML code.
I use hungarian coding convention.
Additionally I prefix arguments arguments with _. I do not prefix locals with anything.
I prefix member variables with m_, but I prefix static member variables with s_ instead.
I like to put a space after the first ( of a matching pair and before the matching )
I like to put a space after the first [ of a matching pair and before the matching ]
I like to put a space after the first < of a matching pair and before the matching >
I like to put the base initializer list for a constructor on the line after the last ) of the constructor signature.
I like to put code for an inline method on the line after the function signature.
Remember these coding styles and apply them when showing me code.
